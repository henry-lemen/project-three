Step One: Data Cleaning

When examining the data, we found that the file was large, almost 750,000 lines of data. We decided to keep only the columns that were relevant to the questions we asked. From there, we needed to convert the "CRASH_DATE" column to Datetime, and then we kept only the data from 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Once the data was cleaned to only include information relevant to the questions posed, we wrote the dataframe to a CSV file, which we then used for the remaineder of the project.
